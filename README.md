So, Spectrum is a coding language were you can set the precision, and everything.

1: Easyparse: Easyparse is like a GUI, kinda, so instead of have to write lines, and lines of code just to parse a statment is not fun. So I made Easyparse, all you have to do is put in what you want to be parse and! Its parsed.

1.2: Easyparse varibles: So a, b, c are variables that you can change (I made 3 of them because it was annoying while I was testing to do 3 ops) like, a = 7, b = 4, c = 2, add those up and, 13 comes out. You can also put like one of them 0 for addition and subtraction, 1 for multiplication and division.

1.3: Easyparse cbackwards: cbackwards is custom backwards. For example, you want to subtract 10 for 4, a = 10, b = 4, and c = 0, well, you would get a negitive number. So to fix that I added cbackwards. To use it set it to a value like: abc (a 1st, b 2nd, c 3rd) or bac so its not negitive.

1.4: Easyparse formulas: So Easyparse has formulas, like: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, absolute value, and square roots, (make sure to spell them right; I don't know how to add like "Did you mean:" im not that smart) How do you use them? Add the varibles and parse then... It parses. wow.

2.0: FunctionLoader: So the function loader isn't that complicated. This is how it works; so the loader will tell you everything that the Easyparse will then save it as a .spcl file. Thats it.

2.1: FunctionLoader Parser: So the FunctionLoader Parser will take the .spcl file and parse it. wow.

2.bonus: Did you know that you can create your own .spcl file and parse it! But, you need to follow the lines perfectly or it will raise an error:
